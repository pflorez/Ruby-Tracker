# Ruby-Tracker
A script for tracking objects

This video takes any video input and can select, track, and output coordinates of any color desired. 

In this case, we focus specifically on tracking orange worms.
By changing the HSV values at lines 46-50 the color desired can be chagned.
To track pure white lines 46-47 function, although they have been commented out in this case.

#Bsub
A script to subtract a static background from a moving image.

Takes a video as input and selects a few frames to find a background that remains static and blacks out all
static images. Any changing image displays as pure white.
